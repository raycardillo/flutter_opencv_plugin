# Flutter OpenCV Plugin - NOTICE
Copyright 2019 Ray Cardillo (dba Cardillo's Creations)

----------

This package is a [Flutter plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins) that creates an interface between Flutter and native distributions of OpenCV. This package does not itself distribute OpenCV in source code nor in binary form. However, when you use this package, the Flutter build tools will download dependencies (including OpenCV binaries) and they will be included in your binaries. So if you distribute a binary that depends on this package, it will be subject to the [OpenCV license](https://opencv.org/license/) as well as the [license for this package](./LICENSE).
